AudioRift
----------

AudioRift is a visual HTML5 audio player.
It's primarily a WebAudio toy I use to give some procedural graphics to the audio stuff I create.

This should work on recent version of Chrome and Firefox, however I 
experienced some buggy support in specific cases, depending on the OS or the browser.
